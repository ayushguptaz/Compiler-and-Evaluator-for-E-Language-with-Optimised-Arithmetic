# Compiler-and-Evaluator-for-E-Language-with-Optimised-Arithmetic
- Engineered a compiler design to convert custom E++ language expressions for execution for a stack-based virtual machine
- Designed a Symbol Table using AVL Tree for O(log(N)) efficiency for variable assignment operations, including insertion & lookup
- Constructed a Parser to convert arithmetic expressions into expression trees, enabling recursive evaluation in Postorder
- Implemented the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to optimize the multiplication of large numbers in O
